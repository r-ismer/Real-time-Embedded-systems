# Real-time-Embedded-systems

## Objective of the course

A real time system has to accept important temporal constraints. A real time embedded system must be able to react to events with a limited time. 
During this course, the measures of response time to interruptions are studied and tested in laboratories, such as for example the influence of dynamic memories, of cache memories, of option of compilation. Measurements of response time to the interruptions, tasks commutations, primitives of synchronizations are carried out on an embedded system based on a FPGA.
Multiprocessors, accelerators, custom instructions, specialized hardware are some ways to improve the performance of a specific application. Those concepts are developed through laboratories and a mini-project.

## Work done

We had to implement a full embedded system based on a FPGA and softcore NIOSII processors and/or an hardcore ARM-A9 multi-processors. Embedded operating system, specialized interfaces and specific architectures are the basics tools of the course.
We had to develop a system with specialized function as a final project. A final presentation and demonstration will have been part of the evaluation. Regular work reports completed the evaluation.
